								<h3>Nice to meet you!</h3>
								<p>Since studying in University of California, Irvine as a Master of Computer Science student,
								I have been focusing in a lot of <b>backend programming</b>, including from building websites with database to utilizing artificial intelligence.<br/>
								Familiar with languages, databases and frameworks, such as <u>Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Django.</u><br/>
								<br/>
								<b>*Trivia About Me*</b><br/> I came from <b>multicultural</b> family; I can speak fluent Korean and Chinese. I have taught myself Japanese and Spanish, since I like learning languages. Currently, I'm able to order food in at least 5 different countries without making fun of myself. <br/>
								I have a <b>biochemistry</b> undergraduate degree which has helped me to think outside of box with diverse perspective. Also, thanks to my science degree, now I am a strong believer in the spherical Earth and evolution theory.<br/>
								<br/>
								<b>Future goals:</b> With my diverse backgrounds and strong passion in computer science, I'd like to provide domestic/international services that can enrich the multi-cultural societies, and improve the understanding between many different cultures through the power of programming. <br/>
